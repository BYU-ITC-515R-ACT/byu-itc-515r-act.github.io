# CTF Practice 1

This homework is designed to give you additional experience with Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, with an emphasis on **very easy** problems. In the NCAE CyberGames, a large number of points are available through the CTF. If you earn few or no CTF points, your chances of winning are very low.

## What Is a Jeopardy-Style CTF?

A **Jeopardy-style CTF** is a competition format where participants are presented with a wide variety of challenges organized into categories, similar to the game *Jeopardy*. You choose which challenges to solve.

Each challenge contains an intentionally introduced vulnerability. Your goal is to exploit that vulnerability to obtain a **flag**, which is a string you submit for points.

In NCAE, all flags follow this format:

```
c2ctf{...}
```

Every flag starts with `c2ctf` and is enclosed in curly braces.

## Common CTF Categories

Typical CTF categories include:

* Web Exploitation
* Reverse Engineering (RE / Rev)
* Forensics
* Binary Exploitation (Pwn)
* Cryptography

Most challenges in these categories are **out of scope for regionals**, and any that do appear will be very basic.

NCAE also includes several **custom SIEM-related categories**, which is why you will complete Splunk training as part of this assignment.

## Assignment Structure

This lab is divided into multiple sections by category.

For **each category**, you must submit **one PDF** containing screenshots showing completion of **all three required tasks**.
This PDF should be uploaded to **Learning Suite**.

## Expectations

If you have questions about the assignments:

* Look online
* Google concepts
* Use documentation

During the actual CTF, you will **not** receive external help from instructors. You are expected to solve these challenges independently. Most challenges include helpful hints.

## Required Tasks
