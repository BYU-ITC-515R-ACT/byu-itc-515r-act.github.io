| **Presentation and Format** | **P4:** The report follows the basic format (single page, 12pt Times New Roman, double-spaced) but has issues with organization, spelling, or grammar (e.g., several typos, and formatting errors). | **M4:** The report is flawlessly presented, following the required format exactly with no errors in organization, spelling, or grammar. |
