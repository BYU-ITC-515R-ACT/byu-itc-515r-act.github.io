| **SSH Installation and Configuration** | **P1:**  Install the OpenSSH server and client. Connect to the server from a client machine. | **M1:** Modify the SSH configuration file to change the default port. Disable root login and password-based authentication in favor of key-based authentication. | **D1:** Configure SSH to use specific IP addresses, and user and group restrictions. |
| **SSH Key Generation and Management** | **P2:**  Generate SSH key pairs using `ssh-keygen`. Copy the public key to a remote server and connect using key-based authentication. | **M2:** Manage multiple SSH keys for different users. | |
| **SSH Hardening** | **P3:** Limit the number of failed login attempts, set timeout restrictions and max sessions. | | **D2:** Use a tool to automatically block IPs after several failed login attempts. |
| **SSH File Transfers** | **P4:**  Securely copy files between local and remote systems. | | |
| **Logging and Monitoring SSH Activity** | **P5:**  View basic SSH logs and identify failed login attempts and successful connections. | **M3:** Search commands run by authenticated users. |  |
| **Troubleshooting** | **P6:**  Verify SSH service status. Check config files for syntax errors and/or misconfigurations. | **M4:** Investigate key-based authentication issues. |  |
| **FTP Installation, Configuration, and User Management** | **P7:** Install an FTP server. Connect to the FTP server from a client using an FTP client or command-line tool. Create FTP-specific users on the server. Assign home directories for FTP users. Limit FTP users to their home directories. | **M5:** Set up default directories for users. Set different permissions for different users. | |
| **FTP Security** | **P8:** Disable anonymous login to the FTP server. | **M6:** Modify the FTP configuration to restrict access to users or groups. |  |
| **Troubleshooting** | **P9:** Verify the FTP service status. Ensure that the correct port(s) are configured. Check the FTP server configuration files for syntax errors | **M7:** Check the FTP server configuration files for misconfigurations. Diagnose connection issues related to passive and active FTP modes. Review logs for failed login attempts or file transfer errors. Verify the FTP server allows the correct type of authentication. |  |
| **Verbal Pass off** | **P10:** Successfully answer two TA chosen pass off questions.|
