## Fortnightly Vulnerability Reports 

These assignments will make up 7% of your grade. This assignment should be a single page, 12pt, Times New Roma double-spaced. Two options are available that will fulfill the requirement for the biweekly reports: 

1. Recently discovered vulnerabilities or  

1. New ways of defending a system or service  

While not directly related to the class content, it will help encourage you to stay updated with the rapidly evolving changes in cybersecurity. It will also help you as you develop your research skills in identifying credible sources and analyzing the latest information.  

## Memes 

Incorporating memes into this class may seem unconventional, but it effectively helps you engage, simplifies complex concepts, and fosters creativity and critical thinking and will make up 3% of your overall grade. By creating and sharing memes, you can distill and communicate cybersecurity issues humorously and concisely, making the material more relatable and memorable. This approach leverages popular culture to help enhance your learning and provides a refreshing break from traditional coursework.  

The memes should be Cybersecurity or technology-related in some way. You can use existing memes or create your own. All memes should be in line with BYU standards and the honor code.  

## Homework 

Homework assignments will make up 20% of your grade and be divided into 10 separate assignments. Homework questions will consist of a variety of questions made up of True/False, Fill the Gap, and one-to-three-word answers. The homework assignments will be administered in a CTF-style format through CTFD. You will receive instructions on how to access the website during the first week of class. Homework will be due BEFORE the class period in which that topic will be discussed, the only exception will be Homework 10 which will be CTF practice and due the Thursday following the class period that covers the topic. 

## Individual Labs 

There will be 10 labs that make up 40% of your grade. Each lab will test you on a different technology and service and are services that are very commonly used around the world. While we will cover the theoretical knowledge about the technologies in class the labs will be where you will learn the practical application of that knowledge. You will be expected to do research on your own and develop troubleshooting and debugging skills as part of this class. However, if you are really stuck the instructor and TA are there to help you learn. 

## Team Labs 

There will be two team labs during the class. Each lab will make up 5% of your overall grade. Your score for these two assignments will consist of your performance on the lab as rated by your teammates and the overall score on the assignment.  

Teams will consist of 5 people and have a time limit of 6 hours. These labs will be administered on a Saturday. Make-up assignments will not be given if you are unable to attend unless it is a university-excused absence. The labs will start promptly at 9:00am. At noon there will be a 1-hour break where you will not be able to access your machines. This break is designed to give you time to eat and discuss with your team how the assignment is going. After the hour has elapsed you will regain access to your VMs, and the last 3 hours will begin.  

These assignments are designed to help you prepare for the NCAE Cyber Games competition if you are participating and will also include some CTF challenges along with the systems setup and hardening that you will do.  

## Exams  

There will be 3 exams and no make-up exams will be given. If you miss an exam due to an excused absence (documented illness, university-sponsored event/trip, etc.), a make-up exam will be given at the instructor's discretion. If any attempt to obtain answers from students who have already taken the exam is made, you will not be permitted to take the make-up exam regardless of the situation. If you require any accommodations, please let the instructor know at least 48 hours before the exam where possible.  

The exams will consist of two midterms and one final exam worth. The exams will be practical assessments of your technical skills. Midterm 1 will select service(s) already covered before the exam and require you to set it up and secure it from attack. You will be given the full 4 hours to complete the exam but it should take no more than 2 hours.  Midterm 2 will be administered as a CTF that will start during the class period. The midterm will remain open for 1 week.  

The final will be the combination of the midterms where you are given services to set up and secure from attack and given several CTF problems to solve. However, unlike the midterms the final will be taken in teams of 10.  There will be a 7 hour block with a 1 hour lunch break during finals week in which the final will be administered. The exam will promptly start 5 minutes after class has begun, if you arrive after the exam has started you will not be permitted to take the exam. Once your team have achieved the desired score you may all leave together. 

Midterms will be taken during the class period, and the final will be taken during the allotted time for the final. All exams will be taken in person, unless otherwise stated.  

If you are participating in the NCAE Cyber Games Regional competition you may choose to substitute your participation with one of the midterm exams. The substitution is worth a distinction grade on the exam. You will be required to write a 1-page double-spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman paper on what you learned during the competition for the substitution to count.  

If you are participating in the NCAE Cyber Games invitational, you may choose to replace the final exam with your participation. If you plan on making this substitution, email the instructor.  

 
## Late work 

You will be given 4 grace days for the entire semester. Grace days may be used on the following assignments: 

- Fortnightly Reports 
- Memes 
- Individual Labs 

Grace days and may not be used on: 

- Homework assignments 
- Team labs 
- Exams 

If you run out of grace days or choose not to use them the late penalty will be 10% a day up to 50%. Late penalties only apply to the same assignments grace days can be used for. All other assignments will not be accepted late.  

## Grading Scale  
Grades will be assigned as on a three tier system that will convert to A,B,C or E. There will be no + or - grades.
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="1">A</td>
            <td rowspan="1">Distinction</td>

            <td rowspan="1">Fail</td>
        </tr>    
    </tbody>
</table>


At the end of the semester, your grade will be assigned to you in a strictly objective manner empirically based on your aggregated scores on all course assignments and requirements. Grades, therefore, are never available for negotiation, and any attempt by the student to enter a discussion in this regard will be viewed as disrespectful to the instructor and the University. 


## Course Policies 

The proper classroom climate and expectation of professionalism in class behavior and activities will assist students in developing the habits and etiquette that contribute to their career success. Therefore, these classroom policies that promote and maintain a professional atmosphere of learning in the classroom are created and maintained. 

### Classroom & Computer Lab Behavior 

It is expected that: 

- Students will arrive for class on time 
- Students will keep their cellphones and devices in silent mode during class 
- Students will refrain from engaging in non-class related conversations during class 
- Students will refrain from reading non-class related material during class 
- Students will refrain from sleeping in class 
- Students will always conduct themselves in a courteous and professional manner  


### Absence Policy 

Regular attendance is expected for the full class time. A student’s presence and participation in class are critical factors towards the completion of the work for the class and achievement of success in the course. A student who is absent from class, if possible, and as a matter of courtesy, should inform the instructor in advance of the absence. If absences occur, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor regarding making up the work missed. Permission to make up course assignments will be granted solely at the discretion of the instructor.  

### Honor Code 

In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about those standards. 

### Preventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct 

The health and well-being of students is of paramount importance at Brigham Young University. If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harassment (including sexual violence), there are many resources available for assistance. 

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, BYU prohibits unlawful sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, against any participant in its education programs or activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment by its personnel and students. Sexual harassment occurs when a person is subjected to unwelcome sexual speech or conduct so severe, pervasive, and offensive that it effectively denies their ability to access any BYU education program or activity; any aid, benefit, or service of BYU is conditioned on a person's participation in unwelcome sexual conduct; or a person suffers sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking on the basis of sex. 

University policy requires all faculty members to promptly report incidents of sexual harassment that come to their attention in any way, including through face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of sexual harassment should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692 or 1085 WSC. Reports may also be submitted online at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24 hours a day). 

BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by sexual harassment, including the university's Sexual Assault Survivor Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university's Sexual Harassment Policy, reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the university's Title IX Coordinator. 

### Student Disability 

Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Whether an impairment is substantially limiting depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or hearing impairments, physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders, and attention disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have a disability that impairs your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC, or 801-422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, please contact the Equal Opportunity Office at 801-422-5895, eo_manager@byu.edu, or visit https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity for help. 

### Diversity and Inclusion in the Classroom 

"Because we feel the depth of God's love for His children, we care deeply about every child of God, regardless of age, personal circumstances, gender, sexual orientation, or other unique challenges" (President Russell M. Nelson, "The Love and Laws of God," September 2019). As a university community, we strive to foster an educational environment that promotes the personal dignity of every student and accept individual responsibility to eliminate racism, sexism, and nationalism. Our course participation reflects our understanding that every individual is a child of Heavenly Parents. We create learning environments in which every individual is motivated to express their opinions and perspectives and ask questions to augment discussions and learning. We listen to, learn from, and strive to consider thoughtfully the opinions of others. We use language that is polite, considerate, and courteous—even when we strongly disagree. 

 
### Inappropriate Use of Course Materials 

All course materials (e.g., outlines, handouts, syllabi, exams, quizzes, PowerPoint presentations, lectures, audio and video recordings, etc.) are proprietary. Students are prohibited from posting or selling any such course materials without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course. To do so is a violation of the Brigham Young University Honor Code. It is also unethical to post your own work (study sheets, papers) from the course on file-sharing websites as you are encouraging others to engage in plagiarism. These policies continue indefinitely (not limited to the duration of the semester or term you take this course). 

### Respectful Environment 

"Sadly, from time to time, we do hear reports of those who are at best insensitive and at worst insulting in their comments to and about others... We hear derogatory and sometimes even defamatory comments about those with different political, athletic, or ethnic views or experiences. Such behavior is completely out of place at BYU, and I enlist the aid of all to monitor carefully and, if necessary, correct any such that might occur here, however inadvertent or unintentional. "I worry particularly about demeaning comments made about the career or major choices of women or men either directly or about members of the BYU community generally. We must remember that personal agency is a fundamental principle and that none of us has the right or option to criticize the lawful choices of another." President Cecil O. Samuelson, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 "Occasionally, we ... hear reports that our female faculty feel disrespected, especially by students, for choosing to work at BYU, even though each one has been approved by the BYU Board of Trustees. Brothers and sisters, these things ought not to be. Not here. Not at a university that shares a constitution with the School of the Prophets." Vice President John S. Tanner, Annual University Conference, August 24, 2010 

**If disrespectful comments are made towards the instructor or other students, you will be asked to leave the classroom to help maintain the respectful nature of the class and its learning environment.** 

### Mental Health 

Mental health concerns and stressful life events can affect students’ academic performance and quality of life. BYU Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS, 1500 WSC, 801-422-3035, caps.byu.edu) provides individual, couples, and group counseling, as well as stress management services. These services are confidential and are provided by the university at no cost for full-time students. For general information please visit https://caps.byu.edu; for more immediate concerns please visit http://help.byu.edu. 

### Academic Honesty 

The first injunction of the Honor Code is the call to "be honest." Students come to the university not only to improve their minds, gain knowledge, and develop skills that will assist them in their life's work, but also to build character. "President David O. McKay taught that character is the highest aim of education" (The Aims of a BYU Education, p.6). It is the purpose of the BYU Academic Honesty Policy to assist in fulfilling that aim. BYU students should seek to be totally honest in their dealings with others. They should complete their own work and be evaluated based upon that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct.  

They should complete their own work and be evaluated based on that work. They should avoid academic dishonesty and misconduct in all its forms, including but not limited to artificial intelligence apps (like ChatGPT, GPT-3 program, or any other AI program), plagiarism, fabrication or falsification, cheating, and other academic misconduct. ChatGPT and other AI programs can be used as tools and a guide with assignments and class work. Attempting to submit any AI-generated content as your own is considered to be academically dishonest. It is to be used as a tool to help you with your work not do it for you. If you use AI to complete assignments or class work the instructor reserves the right to deal with the situation as he/she sees fit. 

### Plagiarism 

Intentional plagiarism is a form of intellectual theft that violates widely recognized principles of academic integrity as well as the Honor Code. Such plagiarism may subject the student to appropriate disciplinary action administered through the university Honor Code Office, in addition to academic sanctions that may be applied by an instructor. Inadvertent plagiarism, which may not be a violation of the Honor Code, is nevertheless a form of intellectual carelessness that is unacceptable in the academic community. Plagiarism of any kind is completely contrary to the established practices of higher education where all members of the university are expected to acknowledge the original intellectual work of others that is included in their own work. In some cases, plagiarism may also involve violations of copyright law. Intentional Plagiarism-Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution to the author through quotation, reference, or footnote. Inadvertent Plagiarism-Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution. Inadvertent plagiarism usually results from an ignorant failure to follow established rules for documenting sources or from simply not being sufficiently careful in research and writing.  

Although not a violation of the Honor Code, inadvertent plagiarism is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions. Students who are in doubt as to whether they are providing proper attribution have the responsibility to consult with their instructor and obtain guidance. Examples of plagiarism include: Direct Plagiarism-The verbatim copying of an original source without acknowledging the source. Paraphrased Plagiarism-The paraphrasing, without acknowledgment, of ideas from another that the reader might mistake for the author's own. Plagiarism The borrowing of words, ideas, or data from an original source and blending this original material with one's own without acknowledging the source. Insufficient Acknowledgement-The partial or incomplete attribution of words, ideas, or data from an original source. Plagiarism may occur with respect to unpublished as well as published material. Copying another student's work and submitting it as one's own individual work without proper attribution is a serious form of plagiarism. 

### Deliberation Guidelines 

To facilitate productive and open discussions about sensitive topics about which there are differing opinions, members of the BYU community should: 
1. Remember that we are each responsible for enabling a productive, respectful dialogue. 
(2)To enable time for everyone to speak, strive to be concise with your thoughts. 
1. Respect all speakers by listening actively. 
1. Treat others with the respect that you would like them to treat you with, regardless of your differences. 
1. Do not interrupt others. 
1. Always try to understand what is being said before you respond. 
1. Ask for clarification instead of making assumptions. 
1. When countering an idea, or making one initially, demonstrate that you are listening to what is being said by others. Try to validate other positions as you assert your own, which aids in dialogue, versus attack. 
1. Under no circumstances should an argument continue out of the classroom when someone does not want it to. Extending these conversations beyond class can be productive, but we must agree to do so respectfully, ethically, and with attention to individuals' requests for confidentiality and discretion. 
1. Remember that exposing yourself to different perspectives helps you to evaluate your own beliefs more clearly and learn new information. 
1. Remember that just because you do not agree with a person's statements, it does not mean that you cannot get along with that person. 
1. Speak with your professor privately if you feel that the classroom environment has become hostile, biased, or intimidating. Adapted from the Deliberation Guidelines published by The Center for Democratic Deliberation.

If you observe any non-emergency dangerous, illegal, or suspicious activity occurring on campus or by a member of the BYU community, please report it through the BYU Compliance Hotline at https://hotline.byu.edu. Emergencies and ongoing criminal activity should be reported directly to BYU Police at 801-422-2911. 

## Electrical & Computer Engineering Policy for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Coursework 

*IT&C Faculty, April 4, 2023* 

As professionals in the fields of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Cybersecurity, it is essential to gain experience using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, which have improved dramatically in recent decades. At the same time, using AI in some educational contexts can undermine educational goals and intellectual growth. This policy is intended to add clarity concerning the use of AI in EC EN and IT&C classes at BYU. It should be treated as the default policy for all such classes unless it is superseded by the instructor of a course who specifically provides exceptions or exclusions for particular assignments. 

*If an instructor does not provide any specific guidance related to the use of AI in their class, then this policy will be in effect.* 

### Guiding Principles 

- Artificial Intelligence is a tool, like many others, that can be used for good and bad. As BYU students, we should focus our attention on how we can ethically use AI to accomplish worthwhile goals. 
- Using AI effectively (e.g., generating useful AI prompts) is an important skill that should be developed. Understanding the limitations of AI including the potential for results to include false statements, bias, and copyright infringement is a critical part of using AI effectively. 
- Learning is a process wherein our minds and spirits are changed as we develop new understandings, attitudes, and skills through deep engagement with content and experiences. AI can be used to enhance or circumvent learning, depending on how it is used and the type of learning occurring. 

### Rules regarding the inappropriate use of AI in EC EN and IT&C coursework 

- AI should never be used when an instructor explicitly asks students not to use it. 
- AI should not be used in any cases where an exam or assignment is “closed book” (i.e., they prohibit the use of resources such as textbooks, the Internet, talking to others, etc.). 
- When using AI for written work that is “open book” (e.g., papers, coding projects, lab reports, take-home exams), any AI content should be cited. For example, if you use AI-generated language it should be put into quotes and the AI engine and text prompt should be listed. If you are paraphrasing AI-generated content, then you should indicate that you are paraphrasing in a citation, similar to how you would if you were paraphrasing another published resource. If you are using an AI code-generation tool that recommends code blocks, then a code comment should be added that clarifies the significant portions of the code were AI-generated. 
- AI-generated answers should not be used when it will circumvent students’ learning. For example, submitting AI-generated personal reflections, book reports, lab reports, or other assignments intended to promote meta-cognition and engagement with content is not allowed.  
- If there is ever a question about whether AI should be used or not, the student should ask the instructor. 

### Examples of appropriate use of AI in EC EN and IT&C Coursework (for cases that do not violate the rules above)  

- AI can be used to help brainstorm ideas. For example, a capstone team may use AI to help generate potential names for their project. 
- AI can be used to help understand code syntax and provide examples. For example, AI coding tools can give examples of CSS rules, which can then be integrated (as appropriate) into coding projects for a class.
- AI can be used, with caution, to gain an overview of certain topics. For example, a student may create a prompt that gives an overview of a technology and use cases for it. Of course, you should treat it like most Internet content and validate what is provided, since it may have inaccuracies or misleading examples. 
- AI can be used to enhance class projects. For example, a UX designer may generate fake text and images that are used in a prototype of a new product. In such cases, the content source should be cited. 

### Repercussions for violations of this policy 

It is our hope that BYU students will strive to follow this policy and discuss potential gray areas with faculty. In cases where students have violated the policy, the instructor of the specific class will determine the appropriate response which may include: 
- giving them a warning and making sure they understand the policy
- reporting them to the honor code office
- giving them a reduced grade on an assignment or in a class
